                    <p class="body-text">
                        To explain shortly, I have used my mother's maiden name as my middle name throughout my academic career since 2007.
                        This is due to a conflict within my family.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">
                        At present, I learned that the name "Angelo Delos Santos" wasn't registered back in 2006-2007 and so I decided to adhere to my
                        legal name to start my professional career.

                    <p>
                        I am a fresh graduate of La Verdad Christian College, Inc., Apalit - Pampanga,
                        and have attained a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems with Latin Honors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Undergoing the esteemed program at my alma matter, I was just a lax and care-free student, somehow grade-conscious, but the institution
                        brought out my potential and have transformed me into a highly potent individual and a highly influential asset with excellence in his work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have gained not just skills and knowledge, but also invaluable connections in the IT Industry as former
                        Vice President for External Affairs in our beloved Association of ICT Majors.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="card-title">Games and whatnot</h2>
                    <p>
                        Games and Films are a major part of my stress management. I am into game genres such as Story, Adventure, FPS, MOBA, Action/Fighting, RTS, and others,
                        and into film genres such as Sit-com, Anime, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Action/Thriller, Horror, Rom-com, War, and more. I am an observant and curious in my childhood to teenage years, and these have significantly helped me
                        build my personality, my intelligence, and my learnability.
